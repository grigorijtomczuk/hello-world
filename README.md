# "hello-world" project

**Hej! This is a small project to test and try GitHub's features and abilities! üíª**[^1]

### How about me?
My name is Grigory. I'm a 16 years old student from Saint-Petersburg, Russia, who aspires to learn everything and everywhere possible regarding to code. As long as I can imagine, my main goal (and dream, simultaneously) is to get a software engineer job at any Swedish company and move to Sweden with my girlfriend, who's going to be my wife by these times!

### Coding begginer checklist
- [x] Install an IDE
- [x] Compile your `"Hello World!"`
- [x] Get along with YouTube tutorials
- [x] Start taking notes
- [x] Hop on a programming course
- [x] Find soulmate learning programmers to study together
- [ ] Complete a finished and fledged project on your own
- [ ] Complete a finished and fledged project with your teammates

### A very useful program
After getting my mind into Python for a while I managed to make a little 'useful' program on my own:
```
import time
import math

digit = 9

name = input("Hello. Please, enter your name: ")
while True:
    try:
        age = int(input("How old are you?: "))
    except ValueError:
        print("Please, enter a number...")
        continue
    else:
        break
while True:
    human = input("Are you a human? [Yes/No]: ")
    if human == "Yes" or human == "No":
        break
    else:
        print("Please, enter 'Yes' or 'No'...")

print("Proccessing the data, please wait...")
time.sleep(3)
for i in range(3):
    print("Still proccessing the data...")
    time.sleep(3)

while True:
    try:
        passcode = int(input("To get the access to the infromation please enter the square root of " + str(digit) + ": "))
    except ValueError:
        print("I can't understand you.")
        continue
    if not passcode == math.sqrt(digit):
        print("Wrong number. Please, try again.")
        continue
    else:
        break

print("Data successfully accessed!")
time.sleep(1)
print("Your name is " + name)
print("Your age is " + str(age))
if human == "Yes":
    print("Congratulations! You're a human!")
else:
    print("I'm sorry, you're not a human...")
time.sleep(2)
```
It asks you a lot of questions to give you your answers back after entering a square root of the `digit` int.
I know, I know... I'm gorgeous üêµ
